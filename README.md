# Warning

Windows defender automatically delete .exe file. You can create testing folder and add it to exclusion files in windows defencer's settings.

# Rules
Rules are simple: 
- Every single cell is updating simultaneously. 
- If dead cell have 2 or 3 adjacent living cells, it become alive.
- If living cell have less than 2 or more than 3 adjacent living cells, it become dead.
